# Zilliqa's Create Transaction Public API in Unity
Intended as a part of Unity SDK for Zilliqa's blockchain RPC as seen [here](https://github.com/Zilliqa/zilliqa-unity-sdk/blob/e1b60bdea56411c29cde408693172314ac95a92d/Assets/Scripts/Transaction/CreateTransaction.cs) before it got modified by the team.
- Drag and drop the **CreateTransaction** prefab in the project to the scene and play
- To check if it succeeded, copy the Transaction hash from the log console and paste it into the search bar of [Zilliqa's testnet block explorer](https://zilscan.io/?network=testnet)
- Here's the source wallet's [history](https://zilscan.io/address/zil132l20stww96s6jf7ash3pyaz7wx3j93gerwl5h?network=testnet) and the destination wallet's [history](https://zilscan.io/address/zil1hpdhkeeg3mty32up0arhk58mgh9gusetawzuzu?network=testnet)
